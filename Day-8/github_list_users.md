## Code Explanation of Variables Used in the github_list_users.sh file. 

#### $1: This refers to the first command-line argument passed to the script or program when it is executed. Command-line arguments are values provided to a script or program when it is run, and they are accessed using special variables like $1 (for the first argument), $2 (for the second argument), and so on.

#### $2: Similarly, this refers to the second command-line argument.

#### So, in the given code:

#### REPO_OWNER is assigned the value of the first command-line argument ($1).
#### REPO_NAME is assigned the value of the second command-line argument ($2).

#### For example, if you run a script with the following command:
```sh
./github_list_users.sh user myrepo
```
